			<h1>We built the company that we'd want to do business with. We hope you do too.</h1>
			
			<h3>
				1 Useful is forever
			</h3>
			<p>
	Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.
				
			</p>
			<h3> 2
			Great service is everything</h3>
			<p>
	We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.
				</p>
				<h3>
					3
					Clarity is king
				</h3>
			<p>
	Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.

			</p>
			<h3>4
	Our customers are our investors</h3>
			<p>
	Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.
			</p>
			<h3>5
	The basics are beautiful</h3>
			<p>
	We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.
			</p>
			<h3>6
	No hidden fees or secret prices</h3>
			<p>
	We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.
			</p>
			<h3>7
	Software should be easy</h3>
			<p>
	Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.
			</p>
			<h3>8
	Long-term contracts are obscene</h3>
			<p>
	No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.
